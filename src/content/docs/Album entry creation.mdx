Album entries can be created from: https://vocadb.net/Album/Create

Before creating the album entry, make sure that the entry belongs to the database:

<RuleEmbedGroup>
  <RuleEmbed ruleId={47} />
  <RuleEmbed ruleId={48} />
  <RuleEmbed ruleId={49} />
</RuleEmbedGroup>

The album entry creation page requires:

- 1) An album name

<RuleEmbedGroup>
  <RuleEmbed ruleId={7} />
  <RuleEmbed ruleId={8} />

  <RuleEmbed ruleId={53} />
  <RuleEmbed ruleId={54} />
</RuleEmbedGroup>

- 2) At least one artist 

If the artist entry doesn't exist, you will need to [create the artist entry](/docs/artist-entry-creation) first.

After submitting the album entry, you can start adding more detailed information to it.
