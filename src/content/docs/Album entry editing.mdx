This page explains how to edit existing album entries.

The edit page also includes buttons for [deleting](/docs/content-removal-guidelines) and [merging](/docs/merging-entries) album entries.

The edit page is split into 6 different tabs:

1. [Basic info](/docs/album-entry-editing#tab-1-basic-info)
2. [Artists](/docs/album-entry-editing#tab-2-artists)
3. [Discs](/docs/album-entry-editing#tab-3-discs)
4. [Tracks](/docs/album-entry-editing#tab-4-tracks)
5. [Additional pictures](/docs/album-entry-editing#tab-5-additional-pictures)
6. [Media](/docs/album-entry-editing#tab-6-media)

## Tab 1: Basic info

The basic info tab includes fields for names, main cover picture, description, album/record type, release events, release date, catalog number, barcode, external links and the entry status.

### Names

General instructions for entry names (= titles) and aliases are documented [here](/docs/entry-names-and-aliases).

Name rules that are specific to album entries:

<BoxGroup>
  <RuleEmbed ruleId={53} />
  <RuleEmbed ruleId={54} />
</BoxGroup>

### Cover picture

A cover picture for the album.

<BoxGroup>
  <RuleEmbed ruleId={55} />
  <RuleEmbed ruleId={56} />
</BoxGroup>

### Album description

The album description is for additional and useful information that doesn't fit into other fields.

[GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github) is supported for formatting.

<RuleEmbed ruleId={23} />

If the original description is in a non-English language, an English translation can be added/moved to a separate field below.

### Record type

Album / Record type (_Original album_, _Single_, _Compilation_) is the main categorization of the album entry.

If unsure which type to use, try to find out how the artists themselves categorize the album. For more elaborate descriptions, refer to Wikipedia, Discogs, or Musicbrainz. More details and examples are available on the [Album types and artist participation](/docs/album-types-and-artist-participation) page.

#### Original album

Album that consists of multiple (more than a single/EP) **original** tracks or only **remix** tracks by one music producer.
*Alternate versions (instrumentals by the same producer and remixes by other producers) are usually not counted.*

#### Single

Contains one or two **original** tracks or only **remix** tracks by one music producer. 
*Alternate versions (instrumentals by the same producer and remixes by other producers) are usually not counted.*

#### EP

Meaning "extended play". Contains 3-5 **original** tracks or only **remix** tracks by one music producer.
*Alternate versions (instrumentals by the same producer and remixes by other producers) are usually not counted.*

#### Split album

Collaboration between two **equal** music producers, where both artists have roughly the same number of songs.

#### Compilation

Collection of songs by multiple music producers/artists.

#### Video

Disc containing mostly music videos, usually a DVD or Blu-ray.

#### Artbook

Book consisting of drawings by one or more illustrators. Can contain a disc/CD of songs.

#### Other

For albums that don't fit into any available category. Should be avoided.

### Release event

Release event(s) of the album, if available. For common [holidays](https://vocadb.net/T/6682/holiday) like Christmas, use the corresponding [tag](https://vocadb.net/T/64/christmas) instead.

<RuleEmbed ruleId={98} />

### Release date

The earliest release / publish date of the album.

<RuleEmbed ruleId={58} fields={["entry_status"]} />

### Catalog number

A catalog number typically follows the format "ABCD-1234." According to [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Release/Catalog_Number):

> "A quasi-unique number assigned by the record label, including alphanumeric characters, often letters followed by numbers, possibly separated by a dash, space, or other punctuation."

### Barcode

Barcodes are usually plain numbers, e.g., 01234567, and can be scanned from the product package.

### External links

External links relevant to the entry.

  <RuleEmbed ruleId={17} />
  <RuleEmbed ruleId={16} />
  <RuleEmbed ruleId={19} />
</BoxGroup>

### Status

Entry status communicates the level of completeness:

- **Draft**: Entry is missing crucial information. This status indicates that additional information is needed or corrections are requested.
- **Finished**: The entry has all the necessary information but hasn't been inspected by a trusted user yet.
- **Approved**: The entry has been inspected and approved by a trusted user. Approved entries can only be edited and tagged by trusted users and above.
- **Locked**: Locked entries can only be edited by moderators and above

## Tab 2: Artists

In this tab, you can add and delete artists who have participated in the album. These changes do not affect the tracklist (song entries).

Artists can also be added as **custom artists**, which adds an artist credit to the song entry as text without creating an artist entry.

<BoxGroup>
  <RuleEmbed ruleId={66} fields={["entry_status"]} />
  <RuleEmbed ruleId={67} fields={["entry_status"]} />
  <RuleEmbed ruleId={64} fields={["entry_status"]} />
</BoxGroup>

### Support status

<RuleEmbed ruleId={62} />

For collaboration albums, none of the artists can be marked as support.

### Artist roles

Same rules as with songs. Refer to the [Artist roles section](/docs/song-entry-editing#Artist-roles).

## Tab 3: Discs

If the album contains multiple discs you may define extra properties for those discs here.

You may specify disc **name** and **type** (Audio or Video).

Name is optional: if not specified, the default "Disc #" will be used, where "#" is the disc number.

## Tab 4: Tracks

<RuleEmbed ruleId={50} />

Songs entries can be connected to the album entry here.

Clicking a track by its name opens the "Track properties" window, which can be used to add artists to the song entry (track). Only the artists which are added in the ["Artists"-tab](/docs/album-entry-editing#tab-Artists) are visible here.

- If the artist participates in most of the songs, it's efficient to select all the tracks and update them instead of adding the artist to the tracks one by one.

<RuleEmbed ruleId={57} />

When the album entry is saved, the new tracks are created as song entries.

## Tab 5: Additional pictures

Additional (official) pictures for the album.

Note that the main picture (cover) is edited on the "Basic Info" tab. Only upload pictures relevant to this album.

## Tab 6: Media

Crossfades and other advertisements related to the album.

- [Media (video) services supported by VocaDB](/docs/supported-streaming-services)

## Update notes

Update notes are optional but should **always** be used if the edit reason or information source is not obvious.

If necessary, use the entry description for visibility or the comment section to ask questions.
