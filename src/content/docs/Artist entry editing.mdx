This page explains how to edit existing artist entries.

The edit page also includes buttons for [deleting](/docs/content-removal-guidelines) and [merging](/docs/merging-entries) artist entries.

The edit page is split into 2 different tabs:

1. [Basic info](/docs/artist-entry-editing#tab-1-basic-info)
2. [Additional pictures](/docs/artist-entry-editing#tab-2-additional-pictures)

## Tab 1: Basic info

The basic info tab includes fields for names, main picture, description, artist type, associated artists, groups and circles, base voicebank, voicebank release date, external links, language(s) and the entry status.

### Names

General instructions for entry names (= titles) and aliases are documented [here](/docs/entry-names-and-aliases).

Name rules that are specific to artist entries:

<BoxGroup>
  <RuleEmbed ruleId={76} />
  <RuleEmbed ruleId={77} />
  <RuleEmbed ruleId={78} />
  <RuleEmbed ruleId={65} />
  <RuleEmbed ruleId={88} />
  <RuleEmbed ruleId={83} />
  <RuleEmbed ruleId={80} />
</BoxGroup>

### Main picture

Main picture of the artist.

<BoxGroup>
  <RuleEmbed ruleId={84} />
  <RuleEmbed ruleId={90} />
  <RuleEmbed ruleId={165} />
</BoxGroup>

### Artist description

The artist description is for additional and useful information that doesn't fit into other fields.

[GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) is supported for formatting.

<BoxGroup>
  <RuleEmbed ruleId={71} />
  <RuleEmbed ruleId={23} />
</BoxGroup>

Subjective artist descriptions can be added with a blockquote along with the source:

```
From [source text](source url):
> I make music
```

Which displays as:

From [source text](https://example.com/):

> I make music

If the original description is non-English, a separate English translation can be added in the field below.

<RuleEmbed ruleId={82} />

### Artist type

Artist type (`Music Producer`, `Lyricist`, `Circle`, `UTAU` ...) is the main categorization of the artist entry.

<RuleEmbed ruleId={81} />

Be careful when changing artist's type when that artist already has songs/albums added. If you do this, generally you need to make sure that artist's roles are still correct, because **changing the type changes the default role for all those existing entries.**

Different artist types are described at [Artist types](/docs/artist-types).

### Associated artists

These fields are available for voicebanks and are displayed when a suitable artist type is selected.

These are inherited to any derived voicebank and can be overwritten when necessary.

Multiple associated artists can be added with the same role (multiple illustrators for example).

#### Illustrator

- Illustrator of the official character/voicebank art.

#### Character designer

- Character designer of the character/voicebank.

<RuleEmbed ruleId={85} />

#### Manager

- Manager of the character/voicebank.

#### Voice provider

- Person who provided their voice for the voicebank.

<RuleEmbed ruleId={86} />

### Groups and circles

For grouping related artists under a shared group/circle.

<BoxGroup>
  <RuleEmbed ruleId={87} />
  <RuleEmbed ruleId={82} />
  <RuleEmbed ruleId={83} />
</BoxGroup>

### Base voicebank

<RuleEmbed ruleId={91} />

For example, the base voicebank for [Megpoid Talk](https://vocadb.net/Ar/21629) is [GUMI](https://vocadb.net/Ar/3).

### Voicebank release date

The release date of the voicebank.

<RuleEmbed ruleId={92} />

### External links

External links relevant to the entry.

<BoxGroup>
  <RuleEmbed ruleId={20} />
  <RuleEmbed ruleId={17} />
  <RuleEmbed ruleId={16} />
  <RuleEmbed ruleId={19} />
  <RuleEmbed ruleId={75} />
</BoxGroup>

### Language(s)

Supported voice synth languages.

<RuleEmbed ruleId={89} />

These are inherited to any derived voicebank and can be overwritten when necessary.

### Status

Entry status communicates the level of completeness:

- **Draft**: Entry is missing crucial information. This status indicates that additional information is needed or corrections are requested.
- **Finished**: The entry has all the necessary information but hasn't been inspected by a trusted user yet.
- **Approved**: The entry has been inspected and approved by a trusted user. Approved entries can only be edited and tagged by trusted users and above.
- **Locked**: Locked entries can only be edited by moderators and above

## Tab 2: Additional pics

Additional (official) pictures for the artist. Most useful for voice synth entries.

Allowed types: .bmp, .gif, .jpg, .jpeg, .png. Maximum size is 8 MB.

## Update notes

Update notes are optional but should **always** be used if the edit reason or information source is not obvious.

If necessary, use the entry description for visibility or the comment section to ask questions.
