Artist type specifies the //most common// role that the artist participates in. Additional roles can be specified with [tags](https://vocadb.net/T/7372/artists).

Be careful when changing artist's type when that artist already has songs/albums added. If you do this, generally you need to make sure that artist's roles are still correct, because **changing the type changes the default role for all those existing entries.**

## Voice Synths

\{TODO Guidelines for splitting voicebank entries\}

### [Vocaloid](https://vocadb.net/T/4857)

The Vocaloid type is reserved only for the voicebanks based on the Vocaloid desktop software (regardless of version). Upgraded versions such as appends use this type as well.

### [UTAU](https://vocadb.net/T/447/utau)

UTAU is identical to the Vocaloid type, except for the UTAU software. Official appends and other upgrades/extensions to voicebanks use this type as well.

### [CeVIO](https://vocadb.net/T/2838)

CeVIO is a vocal synthesis program that released back in 2013. It is built for both speech and singing vocals, with banks for each.

### [Synthesizer V](https://vocadb.net/T/6745/synthesizer-v)

Synthesizer V (also known as SynthV) is a vocal synthesizer created and developed by Dreamtonics.

### [NEUTRINO](https://vocadb.net/T/7430)

TODO

### [Voiceroid](https://vocadb.net/T/486)

A speech synthesizer program developed by AH-Software, released on December 4, 2009. Despite being separate programs, its name is derived from "VOCALOID"; however, while VOCALOID is meant for singing, VOICEROID is meant for speaking.

### [Other voice synthesizer](https://vocadb.net/T/6109/other-vocal-synthesis-engine)

For other voice synthesizers such as [ChipSpeech](http://vocadb.net/T/3077/chipspeech) and [Alter/Ego](http://vocadb.net/T/3384/alterego).

## Human artists

### [Other vocalist](https://vocadb.net/T/7376)

For all other vocalists that are either unofficial or not synthesized. This includes human vocalists.

### [Music producer](https://vocadb.net/T/300)

Music producer is an artist whose main role is to compose or arrange music. Includes both original music and derivatives such as covers and remixes. Also voice manipulation (Vocaloid/UTAU tuning) is included.

### [Cover artist](https://vocadb.net/T/7368/cover-artist)

For artists who cover original songs. Once they start producing original songs, the artist type should be changed to "Music producer".

### [Animation producer](https://vocadb.net/T/20/animator)

Animation producer is an artist whose main role is to create animation, either 2D or 3D. Commonly with the [MMD](http://vocadb.net/Tag/Details/MMD) software.

When choosing between illustrator and animator types, you should investigate whether the artist usually does static images or animation.

### [Illustrator](https://vocadb.net/T/204/illustrator)

Illustrator is an artist whose main role is drawing/creating (still) images. This includes art used in music videos (PVs) and album covers. Also includes artists who are credited for [https://vocadb.net/T/9119](https://vocadb.net/T/9119).

### [Circle](https://vocadb.net/T/2762/circle)

An entity, usually a group of people, that creates music and self-publishes it. Usually circles are selling their works at doujin events such as [Comiket](https://vocadb.net/Es/3/comiket) and [The Voc@loid M@ster](https://vocadb.net/Es/1/the-vocloid-mster).

Sometimes when artists sign up with a record label, they transition from self-publishing circles into more conventional bands. An example of this is the group [Supercell](https://vocadb.net/Ar/249), which started out as with self-publication, but no longer does that.

Usually circle is a group of people, but it's common that music producers have their own "private circle" (personal circle) where they alone are the sole permanent member, and they possibly work with other temporary members.

Generally there is no need to create a separate entry for a "private circle", if the circle has only one permanent member. In this case, generally the circle information can be included in the producer's entry.

### [Label](https://vocadb.net/T/7386/label)

A commercial company with the primary objective of selling and distributing albums and songs.

### [Other group](https://vocadb.net/T/10140/other-group)

For groups of people where neither Circle nor Label is appropriate.

This includes groups of people (bands) that publish songs through a record label.

### [Lyricist](https://vocadb.net/T/246/lyricist)

A lyricist is a person who writes lyrics.

### [Instrumentalist](https://vocadb.net/T/6566/instrumentalist)

Artists who collaborate by playing an instrument.

### [Other individual](https://vocadb.net/T/10141)

For artists such as encoders and audio engineers who don't fit into any other artist types.
