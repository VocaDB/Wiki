Artist entries are pages for human artists (music producers, lyricists, animators, singers, ...), groups (such as circles and labels) and voicebanks.

Note that individual human artists may correspond to [multiple artist entries](/rules/separate-artist-personas).

These entries include artist-related metadata (as _fields_) such as names and external links and _connections_ to other artist entries through two fields: _Associated artists_ (for voicebanks) and _Groups and circles_.

Artists can be connected to song and album entries by editing the relevant song & album entries.

A full list of artist-related rules is available [here](/rules/artists)
