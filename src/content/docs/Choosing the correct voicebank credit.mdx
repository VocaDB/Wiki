With ambiguous crediting it's important to minimize potential credit errors.

If **not** further specified, the default choice in most cases is **the base voicebank**. In some cases they are marked with the text _"unknown"_.

*  "Hatsune Miku" = [Hatsune Miku](https://vocadb.net/Ar/1)
*  "Otomachi Una" = [Otomachi Una (Unknown)](https://vocadb.net/Ar/49701)

There are some exceptions where the base voicebank should be avoided:

For example, **Japanese** "Xin Hua" songs should be credited with the V4 Japanese voicebank, since the base voicebank is Chinese.
* "Xin Hua" =  ["Xin Hua V4 Japanese (Unknown)"](https://vocadb.net/Ar/60459)

Always make sure that the song language matches one of the voicebank languages, except with ["unsupported language"](https://vocadb.net/T/7059) -songs.

When crediting a derived voicebank **based on hearing**, "Hatsune Miku Append (Soft)" for example, it's useful to mark the entry with the ["unconfirmed vocalists"](https://vocadb.net/T/6416) -tag or use the entry edit notes to document the source.

When the vocalist sounds different from the base-version but no further guess exists, the ["unspecified voicebank"](https://vocadb.net/T/2982) -tag can be used.

If the specific voicebank is only partially credited, there are two options depending which piece of information is omitted: 

* "Kamui Gakupo V4" = ["V4 Kamui Gakupo (Unknown)"](https://vocadb.net/Ar/36302)

* "Kamui Gakupo (Power)" =  ["V3 Kamui Gakupo (Power)"](https://vocadb.net/Ar/1763)

Always credit the earliest "Gakupo Power" bank (V3 instead of V4) and remember to add the ["unspecified voicebank engine"](https://vocadb.net/T/9027/unspecified-voicebank-engine) -tag.

Multiengine synths that have no clear/safe-to-assume base voicebanks usually have a corresponding "unknown"-entry. These are grouped under the ["unspecified voicebank engine"](https://vocadb.net/T/9027/unspecified-voicebank-engine) -tag.
