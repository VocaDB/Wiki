*Moderators can edit/remove comments that do not adhere to these rules.*

### 1) Be civil/nice

    Treat others the way you would want to be treated.
    Wikipedia's [Etiquette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Etiquette) 
    and [Talk page guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Talk_page_guidelines) 
    can be applied to our discussions. Serious evidence is recommended for serious accusations.

### 2) Avoid spam/low-effort comments

    We encourage users to provide meaningful information when leaving comments that are not edit-related. Simple opinion comments are not discouraged as long as they contain reasonable substance beyond single phrases such as "I love this song!"
