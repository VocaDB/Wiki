_Moderators can edit/remove comments that do not adhere to these rules._

### 1) Be civil/nice

    Treat others the way you would want to be treated.
    Wikipedia's [Etiquette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Etiquette)
    and [Talk page guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Talk_page_guidelines)
    can be applied to our discussions. Serious evidence is recommended for serious accusations.

### 2) Avoid spam/low-effort comments

Engage in **mature and thoughtful** discussions. **Reactionary, low-effort, or provoking** comments are **not allowed**. Contributions should be **respectful** and aimed at promoting meaningful conversation.
 
It is encouraged that you include all information in a single comment rather than making multiple.
Posting **identical/near-identical** comments on multiple entries will result in them being **deleted**.

### Other
Avoid using the comments to report errors: [Entry Reports](/docs/pinned/entry-reports) should be used for this purpose. However, it's okay to ask about whether or not something is an error using comments if you're unsure.

Feel free to [contact us](/docs/footer/contact) if you want to hide outdated or resolved moderation-related comments from your artist entry.
