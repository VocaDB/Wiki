General instructions for entry names (= titles) and aliases are documented here.

- [Songs](/docs/song-entry-editing#names)
- [Artists](/docs/artist-entry-editing#names)
- [Albums](/docs/album-entry-editing#names)

## Original Language

<RuleEmbed ruleId={24} />

The "Original language" is the language of the most common, official, primary name. This determines the displayed name when the user setting "preferred display language" is set to "Original".

This field is automatically set during entry creation but **doesn't automatically update** when the names are edited.

<RuleEmbed ruleId={25} />

## Primary Name

The primary name of the entry includes the official or unofficial romanization and/or **English translation**.

<RuleEmbed ruleId={26} />

**Do NOT** romanize or translate titles if you do not know the language well enough. **Machine translations are strictly forbidden**. It's better to leave the fields empty than to have them incorrect.

<RuleEmbed ruleId={8} />

<RuleEmbed ruleId={29} />

### Non-English

This field is for any official title in a non-English language, as long as said title does not qualify instead for the Romanized field. This can be in any script, alphabet, or (non-English) language.

### Romanized

This field is for titles that have been transliterated from their non-Latin script to a Latin one. On the database, the most common form of this is romaji; however, this can happen with any non-Latin script, be it Hangul, Hebrew, Cyrillic, or anything else. Do note that languages such as French or Spanish utilize the Latin script, and thus do not qualify for romanization.

Please see the [Romanization guidelines](https://wiki.vocadb.net/docs/romanization-guidelines) for more details.

### English

This field is for titles either officially in English or that have been translated into it.

## Aliases

Aliases are additional names for an entry. These can range from secondary (but still common) translations to alternative official names, the latter being especially common with otherwise [untitled](https://vocadb.net/T/6335) works. Aliases can be in any language or script.
