[Albums](/docs/albums/album-entry-editing#Release-event) and [songs](/docs/songs/song-entry-editing#Release-event) can be connected to a release event. This connection indicates that the album or song was released **during** or **for** that event. For physical events this generally means that the album was first distributed at that event, so the release event date matches album release date.

Events can also be [tagged](/docs/secondary-entry-types/tags) and event participants can be credited with [artist entries](/docs/artists/artist-entry-page).

Examples of events include **physical events** such as [The Voc@loid M@ster](https://vocadb.net/Es/1) and [Comiket](https://vocadb.net/Es/3), and **virtual events** such as [APOLLO](https://vocadb.net/Es/30) and the character birthdays.

For virtual events it's possible that the release date doesn't match exactly with the event date, but usually it's close. For example, for character birthdays the albums might be released a week ahead. In this case it's still **acceptable** to connect the album or song to the release event, as long as the artist or publisher **officially states** that the album or song was released for that event.

In case of an album song, connecting both the album and song to the same event is generally redundant and should be avoided.

When adding an event to a song or album, you can select an existing event, or create a new event from the entry edit page. In case of a new event, the system tries to make an intelligent guess regarding the event series. If no series is found, the event is created as a standalone event, which can later be connected to a series if needed. Whenever **creating a new event from the entry edit page**, please make sure that the **series is selected correctly**.
