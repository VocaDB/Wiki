External links can be added to entries for songs, albums, artists, tags, and events. 

These links serve three main purposes:
1) Provide ways for the viewers to **legally purchase** or download the albums or songs.
2) Provide ways for the viewers to **find out more** about the artists or albums.
3) Provide points of **reference**.

Note that VocaDB is not intended to provide **all the possible** information about artists, nor can users buy albums on VocaDB. Artists' own websites, online stores and sometimes other wikis are better for explaining this. 

The third point means that links to reliable reference sites, such as [VGMdb](https://vgmdb.net/), [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/), and the [Vocaloid Wiki](https://vocaloid.fandom.com/wiki/Vocaloid_Wiki) are encouraged. As long as the linked sites are **reliable**, having more links to such sites makes the information on VocaDB more reliable as well. Links to official sources, such as artists' websites, are even better, but having multiple references is still good.

The link description and category will be guessed automatically based on the URL if the domain is known: [WebLinkMatcher.ts](https://github.com/VocaDB/vocadb/blob/main/VocaDbWeb/Scripts/Shared/WebLinkMatcher.ts)

Link icons are maintained on the [ExtIcons-repository](https://github.com/VocaDB/ExtIcons) and implemented on [ExtLinks.css](https://github.com/VocaDB/vocadb/blob/fe028ea2a13f98cde6c8eecc73150ce132a515d1/VocaDbWeb/Scripts/styles/ExtLinks.css).
