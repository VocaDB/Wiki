- Make sure that the content you're about to add belongs to VocaDB:  [content policy](/docs/other-guidelines/content-policy).

- Make sure to read the **automatic infoboxes** and **edit warnings** for potential edit mistakes. 

- **Do NOT romanize or translate titles if you do not know the language well enough. Machine translations are strictly forbidden**. It's better to leave the fields empty than have it incorrect.

- Entries created should look roughly similiar to those created by trusted users.

- If you're unsure about something, try searching the wiki or **leave a comment** or an edit note.
