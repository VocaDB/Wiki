**Handling abandoned reports**

Entry reports should be handled as quickly as possible. Preferably in less than a week. If the report cannot be handled, then someone needs to post a comment on the reported entry and close the report. Spammers should be banned and reported to [StopForumSpam](https://www.stopforumspam.com/) before closing.

### Rules & Guidelines management

* **[VocaDB Wiki](https://wiki.vocadb.net/)**

### Communication & Social media management

* **Instant messaging platforms**:
** **[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/3bwXQNXKCz)**

**Email sending**

VocaDB uses a service called [Mailgun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mailgun) to send emails. The main benefit is not having to use personal email account for sending emails. [Mailgun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mailgun) also gives handy statistics such as number of emails sent and emails that could not be delivered. Useful if you're wondering what happened to that email sent by VocaDB.

**VocaDB support email group**

Emails sent to **support@vocadb.net** are redirected to private [Google Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Groups). We get some traffic here, mostly spam, but also people requesting accounts to be deleted or something similar. There should be a few people who can read and respond to these emails.

**Communication with foreign users**

* Japanese [#translation channel](https://discord.gg/3bwXQNXKCz)
* Chinese [#translation channel](https://discord.gg/3bwXQNXKCz)

We get a lot of traffic from overseas, mostly Japan and China, but also France and Spain. There are also a few active editors from those countries. Some of them don't speak English. Some of them are editors, some artists. We need someone in charge of contacting these people and translating messages (possibly using other people to do the translation).

### Partnership & Promotion management

**Partner websites**

VocaDB has partnerships with numerous Vocaloid websites. Someone needs to monitor these partnerships periodically. Which ones are still active. Sometimes partners request updating their information such as icons or description. This also includes seeking new partnerships with major Vocaloid-related websites.

See the [partner websites](/docs/documentation/vocadb-partner-websites) page for a detailed list.

### Financial management (Donations)

**Patreon**

[Patreon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patreon) is our main source of funding. Someone should make sure the information on [Patreon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patreon) page is up to date, and monitor incoming money, so that it's sufficient for running the server. Sometimes actions are required regarding [Patreon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patreon). For example, recently they added mandatory taxation. [Patreon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patreon) page needs to declare services it is providing, so that tax can be properly applied. Also, tax form needs to be updated sometimes.

### Website development

**GitHub**

* Technical documentation
* Development, technical planning
* Responding to requests on the issues list
* Transferring issue requests from website to GitHub
* Triage
* Reviewing pull requests
* Build pipeline

**Webmaster tools**

[Webmaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webmaster) tools shows if there's a problem on a certain page. Most common problems are crashes and mobile browsing issues. Crashes can be temporary, but sometimes certain pages are crashing because of the content.

[Webmaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webmaster) tools also includes [sitemap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_map) management, which [GoogleBot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googlebot) uses to index the website. This is important for the website content to be discoverable on Google search. [Sitemap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_map) is automatically generated by [VocaDB SiteMapGenerator](https://github.com/VocaDB/vocadb/tree/main/VocaDb.SiteMapGenerator).

**Maintaining translations**

* Coordinating
* Japanese translation
* Chinese translation
* Other translations

VocaDB user interface is available in multiple languages. Most important translations are Japanese and Chinese. Someone needs to be in charge of updating translations. There can be more people who actually do the translations.

### Server & Domain management

* **Server** ([Windows Server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Server) 2016, [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/) EX41)
** Server security, upgrades
** Backups
** SSL certificates (LetsEncrypt)

* **Domain** ([Joker](https://joker.com/))
** Yearly domain renewals
** Set up DNS, email forwards, aliases

Sometimes we need to register new [domain names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name) or email addresses for service accounts. For example, **service@vocadb.net** would be redirected to **support@vocadb.net**.
