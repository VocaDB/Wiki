## Albums

### Required information to mark as "finished"

* Primary name
* Album cover (if available)
* Album type
* Release date
* Release event (if applicable)
* At least one external link or PV
* All artists who worked on the album (including characters depicted on the cover)

### Album types

* Album: Albums with 6+ tracks, or with a length of 40+ minutes.
* E.P.: Albums with around 3~5 tracks, and any other album described by the artist as an "E.P."
* Single: Albums with 1~2 tracks (excluding instrumental versions of vocal songs), and any other album described by the artist as a "single".
* Game: Games, whether official or fangames.
* Drama: Albums focused on in-character spoken word content rather than music.
* Other: Any album that doesn't fit into one of the above categories.

### Album pictures

Please provide the highest quality image of the album cover that you can find for the main image. The "additional images" tag can be used for pictures of the booklet, CD label, or other supplementary materials. **Please do not include multiple versions of the same image (e.g. multiple cover images of varying quality).**

[TODO: do not add booklet scans if not public]

### Description

The description field can be used for notes, detailed credits (such as specifying what instruments each instrumentalist played), and descriptions from the artist. **Please put ">" before any quoted paragraphs.** See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) for a full list of formatting that can be used in descriptions.

Please **do not** add redundant information, such as the album title, release event, release date, etc.

### Release events

If the album was released at an event, please specify it here. Multiple events can be added if applicable.

### External links

Relevant links can be entered here. For active media links (YouTube, Soundcloud, etc.), please add them to the "Media" tab instead. Acceptable links include:

* The artist's official website, or official album page;
* Announcements on social media from the artist;
* Links to legally purchase the album, or download the albums from platforms like Booth or bandcamp;
* Links to legally stream the album, such as on YouTube or Spotify;
* Links to other database entries for the album (Touhou Wiki, THBWiki, etc.).

Most commercial links should have the "Commercial" type; however, second-hand listings (Suruga-ya, eBay, etc.), should be marked as "Other", since these listings were not created by the artist.

The following links are prohibited:

* Direct download links, even if they're official. If an official download link is on the artist's website, say so in the description;
* Unofficial download links (Doujin Style, TLMC, etc.);
* Illegitimate websites such as Eruce.
