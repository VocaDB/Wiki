## Songs

### Required information to mark as "finished"

- Primary name
- Song type
- Original (if applicable)
- Release date
- All artists who worked on the song (including characters depicted in the PV, if applicable)

### Song types

- Original song: Songs that are not derivatives. This includes original songs from games (by ZUN), and original songs on doujin albums (those that are not based on any Touhou song).
- Arrangement: Songs based on original songs.
- Rearrangement: Songs based on arrangements.
- Cover: Songs where only the vocals are changed. If a song is a cover _and_ an arrangement or rearrangement, please use the arrangement or rearrangement song type and tag the song with [vocal cover](https://touhoudb.com/T/76).
- Instrumental: Instrumental versions of songs. Instrumentals should be identical to the parent version of the song, except for lacking vocals.
- Remaster: Remastered versions of songs with minimal significant changes.
- Short version: Short versions of songs where the only difference is the length. Common for songs used in rhythm games, and songs included in [nonstop](https://touhoudb.com/T/614) albums.
- Music PV: Music videos that are significant enough to have their own entry.
- Drama PV: For dramatic works where music is secondary or non-existent. Despite the name, this also includes voice dramas with no video.
- Other: Any other entry that doesn't fall into a category above (includes [megamixes](https://touhoudb.com/T/846), [talk tracks](https://touhoudb.com/T/959), [blank tracks](https://touhoudb.com/T/1610), etc.).

### Description

The description field can be used for notes, detailed credits (such as specifying what instruments each instrumentalist played), and descriptions from the artist. **Please put ">" before any quoted paragraphs.** See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) for a full list of formatting that can be used in descriptions.

**For songs with multiple originals, the original songs should be specified and linked in the description** (or specified in the external links section).

### Original version

If the original song is in the database, please enter it here. If the song has multiple originals, please enter one of them. Note that you can put the song name in quotes for exact matching, or paste in a URL to avoid searching altogether.

For original songs, this field will disappear. For tracks in the "Other" category that aren't songs, or for arrangements of out-of-scope songs, this field may be left blank.

### Length

Enter the songs length. If you do not enter the ":", the length will be interpreted as seconds and converted (e.g. 300 will be converted to 5:00).

A single BPM or range can be specified. Note that 1015 is the maximum value, so for BPMs higher than that (as in [extratone](https://touhoudb.com/T/1029)), please enter 1015 and make note of the actual BPM in the description.

### Release events

If the song was released for an event (typically contests like [Touhou Nico Dousai](https://touhoudb.com/Es/113/touhou-nico-dousai)), please enter it here. **Do not copy the album's release event to each track.**

### Publish date

Please enter the earliest date the song was released publicly (whether on an album or uploaded for streaming/download).

### External links

Relevant links can be entered here. **Do not link directly to Google Drive, OneDrive, or any other direct download, even if the link is official.** If an official download link is in, say, the description of an official YouTube upload, please note that in the description.
