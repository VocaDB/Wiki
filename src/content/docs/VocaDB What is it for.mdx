## Overview

[VocaDB](https://vocadb.net/) is a free to use collaborative database for [Vocaloid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocaloid), UTAU and other singing synthesizers, with artists, discography, PVs and more. Our goal is to be the most accurate and complete source of Vocaloid discography and artists.

Anyone is able to contribute and correct existing information by creating an account. Artists are encouraged to add their own information, thus providing a way to promote themselves. Entries may be tagged with specific [genres](https://vocadb.net/Tag) and other meta-information. [Album release events](https://vocadb.net/Search?searchType=ReleaseEvent) such as [VoMas](https://vocadb.net/Es/1/the-vocloid-mster) may also be tracked. The site is designed so that it would be comfortable to use by fans around the world, including both western and Japanese users.

## Motivation

Most of the Vocaloid and other voice synth content is in Japanese and distributed across the web. Finding information about a specific artist may be difficult, especially if one doesn't speak Japanese.

[Vocaloid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocaloid) music has some unique features. Instead of live singers, the singing vocals are provided by the software, and the role of those vocals is much more important than in conventional music. Most of the music is produced by individual artists, and self-published in [doujin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doujin) fashion. In the past, most of the albums weren't available on any well-known online stores. Nowadays, Vocaloid albums get uploaded to sites like [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/), [iTunes](https://music.apple.com/us/browse) and [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/).

Japanese artists preferred uploading their works to [Niconico](https://www.nicovideo.jp/), but [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) is better suited for the western community. Thus, popular videos got "reprinted" by fans from [NND](https://www.nicovideo.jp/) to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/). Nowadays, YouTube gets a lot more traffic among the Japanese community than before and artists use both sites equally.

[VocaDB](https://vocadb.net/) aims to collect all relevant information together and provides external links to official sources, such as the artists' websites or online stores, so that fans might be able to find music by the artists or genres they're interested in. Artists could promote themselves by providing links to services where fans can buy their music legally. Fans can also choose whether to view the PV uploaded by the artist himself to [NND](https://www.nicovideo.jp/), or a reprint copied to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/). An unlimited number of media can be linked to a single entry. Even if the media is deleted from the original source ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) or [NND](https://www.nicovideo.jp/)), the entry remains on [VocaDB](https://vocadb.net/) and in users' collections.

## Core attributes

In the order of importance.

- **Accessibility**:
  the website needs to be quick and easy to browse. Finding relevant information must be as easy as possible. The website is intended to be usable internationally and in many languages. This includes usability for the editors: it should be as easy as possible to reference entries and check for duplicates.

- **Reliability**:
  the information presented should be as correct as possible. Sources/references are required for all non-trivial information, so that the information can be verified.

- **Completeness**:
  the information should be as complete and accurate as possible. This means having entries for all relevant Vocaloid songs, albums and artists with detailed information.

## History

Development of [VocaDB](https://vocadb.net/) started in **late 2010**, albeit in a very different form from now, as it was only meant for tracking songs and their appearances at the weekly [Vocaloid rankings](https://vocadb.net/SongList/Featured?categoryName=VocaloidRanking) on [Niconico](https://www.nicovideo.jp/). Later, artist information was also added, including translations and circles. In the **middle of 2011**, the site was refactored into a community editable wiki-like database.

The official open beta was announced on **31.10.2011** on the now defunct original [MikuDB](http://mikudb.moe/welcome-new-home-mikudb/). Since then, the site has not changed fundamentally, but new features keep being added when possible.

## Comparison with other similar services

[VocaDB](https://vocadb.net/) is a custom site, developed from scratch for [Vocaloid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocaloid) (and related technologies and tools such as [UTAU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utau)) discography in mind. This has allowed us to provide the best possible user experience for both content editors and fans browsing the site.

Whether you're trying to find a specific album or discover new music, we try to make that as effortless as possible with the comprehensive search options. Keep track of your album collection and favorite songs, regardless of how and where those were published. High usability extends to adding content to the database: for example, when registering a song from [Niconico](https://www.nicovideo.jp/), often it's simply enough to input the URL of the video, and the creator, title, vocalists and tags of the song will be associated automatically (when possible). The database will also be scanned for the song being added, to avoid duplicates. No need to edit markup when adding albums, artists or songs; only fill the minimal amount of form fields.

[VocaDB](https://vocadb.net/) does not aim to cover everything related to [Vocaloid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocaloid). We focus on the musical content: music artists, albums and songs. News reporting, lengthy artist descriptions and fanart are better left for general blogs, wikis and image galleries. [VocaDB](https://vocadb.net/) is supposed to be the starting point when finding or discovering a particular album or song, linking to other sites for more in-depth information.

## Statistics

Currently (October 2025), the database contains over **131 000** [artist entries](https://vocadb.net/Search?searchType=Artist), **33 000** [album entries](https://vocadb.net/Search?searchType=Album) and **783 000** [song entries](https://vocadb.net/Search?searchType=Song). Roughly half of those are considered as "finished". More statistics can be found [here](https://vocadb.net/stats).
