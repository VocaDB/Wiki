## Why is this song entry in VocaDB even though it has no Vocaloid?

Songs covered by 5 song entries with vocal synthesis are allowed in VocaDB. Songs included in an album with a vocal synthesis are also allowed.

## I uploaded a new image and it doesn't change!

This happens because of the caching happening on Cloudflare and your browser. Wait around 24 hours for the cache to expire and update to the new image.

For more information, see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/VocaDB/vocadb/issues/1994).
