Artists are created through the artist entry creation page: https://vocadb.net/Artist/Create

Make sure that the entry belongs to the database: [content policy for artists](/docs/other-guidelines/content-policy#artists).

Artist entries can be created with:

- [Name](/docs/artists/artist-entry-editing#tab-basic-info)
- [Description](/docs/artists/artist-entry-editing#artist-description) OR [External link](/docs/artists/artist-entry-editing#external-links)

Also, at least one [song entry](/docs/songs/song-entry-creation) should be attached to the artist entry.

These are the **same** as [finished artist entry requirements](/docs/artists/artist-entry-editing#finished-artist-entry-requirements).

After submitting the artist, you can add more detailed information to the entry on the [artist edit page](/docs/artists/artist-entry-editing).
