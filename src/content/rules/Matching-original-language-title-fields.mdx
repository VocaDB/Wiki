The 'Original language' title field should be filled in the corresponding 'Primary name' title field; the former should not be Unspecified, and the latter should not be empty (unless tagged with [untitled](https://vocadb.net/T/6335/untitled)).

For example, the song [ECHO](https://vocadb.net/S/68814) has its 'Original language' title field set to English, while its English 'Primary name' title field contains its proper title and is thus not empty.
