Copyright tags can be created for a few reasons:

1. Official: IP utilizes voice synth music within the product (anime/game/etc).
2. Official: IP utilizes voice synth music to promote the product.
3. Unofficial: (Original) fansongs inspired by the IP ([Parody](https://vocadb.net/T/330) songs, [Image songs](https://vocadb.net/T/7989), etc).
4. Unofficial: Derived (remix/cover) songs of official IP music.

Avoid creating tags for 3 and 4 if they do not apply to **at least 5** entries.
