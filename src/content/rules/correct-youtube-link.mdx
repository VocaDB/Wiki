If artist entries include Youtube URLs, at least one non-handle version must be included.

- Handle URL: https://www.youtube.com/@YouTube
- Default URL: https://www.youtube.com/channel/YouTube
- Custom URL: https://www.youtube.com/c/YouTube
- Legacy URL: https://www.youtube.com/user/YouTube

Adding links with different URL formats is encouraged because they can be useful for recognition and archival purposes. 

Handle URLS "@" (for example https://www.youtube.com/@YouTube) are not currently supported by the system that adds relevant artists to songs on the song submission page, so if an artist has only the "@" url, you will have to add the artist manually.
