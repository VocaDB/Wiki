A **cover** (カバー曲) is a re-recorded version of a song, usually by a different artist.

In the voice synth world, covers often use a different voicebank while keeping the instrumentals intact.

[Self-cover](https://vocadb.net/T/391) tag is for songs where the original artist covered their own song.

Songs with (only) [changed lyrics](https://vocadb.net/T/2866) or [added lyrics](https://vocadb.net/T/8892) should be marked as covers.

Note that cover entries tagged with [out of scope arrangement](https://vocadb.net/T/10594/) sound instrumentally different from the base entry.
