  When in doubt, credit the base voicebank.

  - "Hatsune Miku" → [Hatsune Miku](https://vocadb.net/Ar/1)
  - "Otomachi Una" → [Otomachi Una (Unknown)](https://vocadb.net/Ar/49701)

If a voicebank is only credited by the character name, and you can't be sure which version it is used, credit the base voicebank or the umbrella "(Unknown)" voicebank. For example:

- "Hatsune Miku": [Hatsune Miku](https://vocadb.net/Ar/1)
- "Otomachi Una": [Otomachi Una (Unknown)](https://vocadb.net/Ar/49701)

There are some exceptions where the base voicebank should be avoided. For example, **Japanese** "Xin Hua" songs should be credited with the V4 Japanese voicebank, since the base voicebank is Chinese.

- "Xin Hua": ["Xin Hua V4 Japanese (Unknown)"](https://vocadb.net/Ar/60459)

[The "unspecified voicebank" tag](https://vocadb.net/T/2982/unspecified-voicebank) can be added to indicate that the credited voicebank is not specified.

Note that the usage of the voicebank could have some clues:

- Not all voicebanks support all languages. As demonstrated with the "Xin Hua" example, the base voicebank is Chinese, but Japanese songs should use the appropriate base voicebank.
- Check when the song was produced and compare it with the voicebank release date. For example, a Kagamine Len song released before 2010 (release of the next year) can be safely credited to [the V2 version](https://vocadb.net/Ar/15).
