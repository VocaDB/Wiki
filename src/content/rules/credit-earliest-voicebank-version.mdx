  When in doubt, credit the earliest voicebank version. 

  - "Kamui Gakupo V4" → [V4 Kamui Gakupo (Unknown)](https://vocadb.net/Ar/36302)
  - "Kamui Gakupo (Power)" → [V3 Kamui Gakupo (Power)](https://vocadb.net/Ar/1763)

If a voicebank is only partially credited, and you can't be sure which version it is used, credit the earliest version.

[The "unspecified voicebank version" tag](https://vocadb.net/T/4862/unspecified-voicebank-version) can be added to indicate that the voicebank version is unknown.

For example, take Kamui Gakupo which credit can be omitted as such:

- "Kamui Gakupo V4": [V4 Kamui Gakupo (Unknown)](https://vocadb.net/Ar/36302)
- "Kamui Gakupo (Power)": [V3 Kamui Gakupo (Power)](https://vocadb.net/Ar/1763)

Note that the usage of the voicebank could have some clues:

- Not all voicebanks have vocal versions. For example. The V2 versions of Hatsune Miku and Kamui Gakupo doesn't have vocal versions (e.g. "Power", "Solid", "Original", "Whisper"). You should still use the earliest version of the voicebank.
- Not all vocal versions available on a version of a voicebank. For example, [the V4 version of GUMI](https://vocadb.net/Ar/41882) has "Fat" versions that has thicker voices. [The previous version](https://vocadb.net/Ar/702) doesn't have them.
- Not all voicebanks support all languages. For example, the only English version of Hatsune Miku is [the V4/V4X version](https://vocadb.net/Ar/49724), so if [it sounds like it's in English](https://vocadb.net/S/286909), it can be safely credited to [the V4/V4X version](https://vocadb.net/Ar/49724).
- Check when the song was produced and compare it with the voicebank release date. For example, the Append version of Hatsune Miku was released in 2010 and the V4X version was released in 2016, so [a 2011 song credited to "Hatsune Miku (Solid)"](https://vocadb.net/S/55131) can be safely credited to "[Hatsune Miku Append (Solid)](https://vocadb.net/Ar/78)".
