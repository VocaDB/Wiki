If the specific voicebank is only partially credited, there are two options depending which piece of information is omitted:

- "Kamui Gakupo V4" = ["V4 Kamui Gakupo (Unknown)"](https://vocadb.net/Ar/36302)

- "Kamui Gakupo (Power)" = ["V3 Kamui Gakupo (Power)"](https://vocadb.net/Ar/1763)

Always credit the **earliest** "Gakupo Power" bank (V3 instead of V4) along with the ["unspecified voicebank version"](https://vocadb.net/T/4862/) -tag.
