A **drama PV** focuses on story instead of music, often made with [MMD software](http://vocadb.net/T/275/mmd). Drama PVs should feature a voice synth character to be accepted on VocaDB.

Drama PVs should be self-made or featuring self-directed stories.

Copying memes, TV shows, or movie scenes are usually not considered drama PVs.
