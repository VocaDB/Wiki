[Drama PVs](https://vocadb.net/T/104/drama-pv) focus on story instead of music, often made with [MMD software](http://vocadb.net/T/275/mmd). They should feature a voice synth character to be accepted on VocaDB.

- Drama PVs should be self-made/self-directed stories.
- Copying memes, TV shows or movie scenes are usually not considered drama PVs.
