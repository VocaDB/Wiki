Remix entries should keep the long title.

For example: *Plug Out (HSP 2012 Remix)*

- Remove clear non-title parts (e.g., original artist credit).
- Remove the vocalist's name if it is separate from the rest of the title.
- Remove the song type if it is separate from the rest of the title.

The same applies for `Remaster` songs.
