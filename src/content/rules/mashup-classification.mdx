A **mashup** is a song made by blending two or more songs together.

Simple mashups where two songs are simply mixed together are discouraged on VocaDB, unless they're well-known or present on an album.

Songs that mix multiple covers of the same song together (joining multiple vocal tracks) should be labeled as covers.

Currently, it's not possible to specify multiple songs as originals in the "original song" field. They should be mentioned in the song description instead.
