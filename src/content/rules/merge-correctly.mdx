excerpt: Merge lower-status entries into higher-status ones, or newer entries into older ones.

Entries should be merged following this priority.

1. Merge the **lower-status** entry into the **higher-status** one. For example, merge the "Draft" entry into the "Finished" entry.
2. If the entries has the same status, merge the **newer** entry into the **older** one. For example, merge the entry with ID 1001 into the entry with ID 1000.
