If the album has multiple versions/editions, create new entries where appropriate and mention these in album descriptions OR in the external links.

There are multiple factors for deciding whether to treat album versions separate or not:

- different tracklist (create separate entries if different tracklists, except for [instrumental](https://vocadb.net/T/208/instrumental) tracks or [bonus tracks](https://vocadb.net/T/44))
- additional discs
- different cover art
- different catalog number

Also append the album version the the album name if appropriate: "(Regular Edition)" or "(Kagamine Rin version)"

Also include the [multiple editions](http://vocadb.net/T/4877/multiple-editions) tag.
