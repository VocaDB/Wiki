A **music PV** (also known as music video/MV, promotional video/PV) is a video integrating a song, usually for promotional or musical purposes. The "Music PV" song type is used for **remarkable** music videos of (usually original) songs, whether created by the original producer (regardless of style style) or someone else (featuring in-scope characters).

PVs that consist entirely of a single still image or that are otherwise low-effort are not to be added as separate entries; those that match the length of the original song can be added as "Other" media to the original entry if needed.

If an unofficial PV is not noteworthy, and it doesn't match the length of the original song, it should not be added.

By creating a separate entry for the PV, the animator and other people involved can be credited accordingly, and things like MMD models used can be indicated with tags. Sometimes, the PV might even be more well known than the originally published version of the song; this can be seen with [wakamura's "Sweet Devil" PV](https://vocadb.net/S/11498) and [kkkk's "Love is War" PV](https://vocadb.net/Ar/18565).

The tag can also be used as a secondary song type (tagged) to indicate a newer version of a song (remaster, cover, etc.) with a different video than the original.

Remember to also [credit the vocalists](/rules/vocalist-entry-credit-required) for music PVs. Silent characters (that have no vocals in the PV) **should not be credited as artists**. Model tags (such as [CHAN x CO Miku](https://vocadb.net/T/1641/chan-x-co-miku)) can be used if applicable, regardless whether the character has vocals or not.
