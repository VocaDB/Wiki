The [Music PV](https://vocadb.net/T/7378/music-pv) (also known as music video/MV, promotional video/PV) type is used for **remarkable** music videos of (usually original) songs, whether created by the original producer (regardless of style style) or someone else (with in-scope characters).

Remember to also [credit the vocalists](/vocalist-entry-credit-required) for Music PVs. Silent characters (that have no vocals in the PV) **should not be credited as artists**. Model tags (such as [CHAN x CO Miku](https://vocadb.net/T/1641/chan-x-co-miku)) can be used if applicable, regardless whether the character has vocals or not.
