If a song entry lacks a video, then the first official video should be added to the main entry unless said video is of a different length or noticeably changes the audio.

Anything posted onto BiliBili, YouTube, NicoNicoDouga, or a similar website counts as being a "video", unless said upload is auto-generated or directly attached to the [Vocaloid Anonymous Uploading Festival](https://vocadb.net/Es/525/vocaloid-song-anonymous-upload). Conversely, anything posted to an audio-only site counts as lacking a video.
