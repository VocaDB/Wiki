If the song lacks a PV (i.e. it was uploaded to Soundcloud or Bandcamp, it has an auto-generated YouTube upload, or it is part of the Anonymous Posting Festival), then the first official song PV should be added to the main entry unless the PV is of a different length or otherwise changes the audio.
