Do not create duplicate entries of any type. Make sure to check multiple variations of names/aliases of the entry before deciding to create a new entry.

If you created a duplicate, you can either [report the duplicate entries to be merged](/docs/entry-reports#duplicate-entry) or, as [a trusted user](/docs/trusted-users), [merge the entries](/docs/merging-entries) by yourself.

One exception of this rule is when creating [separate artist personas](/rules/separate-artist-personas).
