It's common to see artists credited with added honorifics, especially in Japanese (e.g. "-san"/"さん", "-sama"/"様").

These honorifics should not be added as the artist name on VocaDB, unless the artist uses those themselves, such as:

- [外道さん (Gedou-san)](https://vocadb.net/Ar/1823)
- [P丸様。 (P-Maru-sama.)](https://vocadb.net/Ar/139823)
- [Mr.Hedgehog](https://vocadb.net/Ar/81441)
- [Mr. Unknown](https://vocadb.net/Ar/49412)
- [Mrs. Pumpkin](https://vocadb.net/Ar/55077)

Note that, while this rule applies when creating/editing artist entries, you should also consider this when adding artist credits so that you can find the existing artist entry (by excluding the honorifics).
