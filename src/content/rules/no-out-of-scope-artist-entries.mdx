Artists that are not voice-synth-related should not be added to the database.

For illustrators, this rule can be ambiguous.

- Stock photo credits should generally be credited with the custom artist feature (no entry).
- Illustrators with voice-synth related artworks should have an entry.
- Illustrators who collaborate a lot with different voice-synth artists should have an entry.

Artists that are **directly** participating/collaborating (including illustrators) should/can have artist entries: Animators, lyricists, other individuals, etc.
