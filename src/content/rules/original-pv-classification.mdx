The Original PV type is used for authorized content uploaded by a party with rights to both audio and video.

Usually, this is the artist/producer themselves or someone uploading on their behalf. In case this is not obvious how the upload was authorized, clarify this in the update notes.

See [the respective section on the Song entry editing page](/docs/song-entry-editing#original) for more information.
