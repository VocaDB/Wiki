[Original songs](https://vocadb.net/T/6479/original-song) ("オリジナル曲" in Japanese) are songs that have completely original content and aren't based on other songs.

The original song is the version of the song that was published first. Later versions are considered derivatives **regardless of who made them**.

For original instrumental (album) songs, use the "Original song" type with the ["instrumental" tag](https://vocadb.net/T/208) (see [related rule](/rules/instrumental-tag)). The "Instrumental" song type is for **instrumental versions** of original songs.
