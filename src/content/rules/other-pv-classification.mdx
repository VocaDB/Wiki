import RuleEmbed from "@/components/markdown/RuleEmbed.astro";

The Other media/PV type is used for subtitled PVs or PVs modified from the original that don't justify a new entry.

For some songs, only PVs with this type may exist, where an authorized/official PV is not available. This is common for album-only songs.

The audio should still be the same as the original (see [Rule: Same audio](/rules/same-audio)).

See [the respective section on the Song entry editing page](/docs/song-entry-editing#other) for more information.
