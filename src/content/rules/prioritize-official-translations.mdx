If available, the official romanization and/or translation should be used as the primary name in favor of other translations/romanizations, even if other translations/romanizations are more known or the romanization breaks [VocaDB romanization rules](/docs/romanization-guidelines).

Note that alternative names can be put as an alias of an entry.

## Examples

For "[Servant of Evil](https://vocadb.net/S/1358)", despite the more known "Servant of Evil" title, the official translation, "His significance of existence", should be used as the primary name.

  <Alert variant="incorrect">
    <></>
    **English**: Servant of Evil
  </Alert>
  <Alert variant="correct">
    <></>
    **English**: His significance of existence
  </Alert>
</BoxGroup>

For "[DUNE](https://vocadb.net/S/157860)", although the transliteration "Sand Planet" is popular, the official translation, "DUNE", should be used as the primary name.

    <></>
    **English**: Sand Planet
  </Alert>
  <Alert variant="correct">
