If available, the official romanization and/or translation should be used as the primary name in favor of other translations/romanizations, even though more known translations/romanizations are available or the romanization breaks [VocaDB romanization rules](/docs/romanization-guidelines).

## Examples

For ["Servant of Evil"](https://vocadb.net/S/1358), despite the previous title is more known, the official translation, "His significance of existence", is used as the primary name.

For ["DUNE"](https://vocadb.net/S/157860), despite the transliteration "Sand Planet", the official translation, "DUNE", is used as the primary name.
