A [remix](https://vocadb.net/T/371/remix) is a version of a song modified from the original recording, often featuring a change in musical genre or arrangement.

Remixes may or may not involve recording new music, often using samples from the original.

This song type should also be used even when the remix was made by the original artist. The ["self-remix" tag](https://vocadb.net/T/392/self-remix) should be used in this case.
