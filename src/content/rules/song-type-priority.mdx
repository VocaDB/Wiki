excerpt: The priority of the song type is Mashup/Remix > Remaster > Cover > Music PV
---

The priority of the type of a song entry are as follows.

> Mashup/Remix > Remaster > Cover > Music PV

This means that the "Mashup" or "Remix" type take precedence to the "Remaster" type, then the "Remaster" type takes precedents to the "Cover" type, and so on.

For example:

- A mashup/remix with changed vocals should use the "Mashup" or "Remix" type.
