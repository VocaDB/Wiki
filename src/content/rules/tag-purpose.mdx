All tags should have at least one valid purpose:

- Discovery: Tag is used for discovering related entries (all genre tags for example).

- Search: Tag is used for searching or locating something already familiar ([animated PV](https://vocadb.net/T/3287) for example).

- Statistical: Tag is used for calculating different statistics ([western producer](https://vocadb.net/T/453) for example).

- Informatory: Tag is used to convey information that doesn't fit into the entry ([entry missing artists](https://vocadb.net/T/2808/entry-missing-artists) for example).
